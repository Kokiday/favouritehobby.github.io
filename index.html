        <p class="para">I don't really know why I like painting. It's more about creativity more than anything. It's like that with a lot of my hobbies - cooking, writing, dancing. They all involve a bunch of creativity which I love to incorporate in my own way. Painting allows me to spread out all my thoughts onto a blank canvas. It allows me to go with the flow and not care about what anyone has to say. My favourite thing to paint is surrealism. I love surrealist art such as the works made by Salvador Dal√≠.
